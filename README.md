# IoT-Plant-Watering-System
Digital Plant Watering System with Soil Moisture Sensor and Photoresistor. Inspired by a field of dragon fruits that need to be illuminated in the night to trigger flowering and filtering. So, I am trying to create a project that adopts the idea by automating turning on and off a lamp based on the environment brightness value.
